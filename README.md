# Interstate Sidecar To Enable Continous Transaction Execution on Mainnet.
Interstate is an extension to the PBS / MEV-Boost pipeline which enables instant and continuous transaction preconfirmations on mainnet, this is a massive UX improvement for Ethereum. 

![Full Design](static/flow.jpg)

Interstate's design optionally allows multiple preconfirmations sidecars to run on the same validator. This design promotes decentralization: https://docs.interstate.so/research/multiparty-preconf. This is still in development and the single sidecar setup is ready and recommended for now.
